This first project aims to use AdaIN style transfer in order to generate artificial training data wor the wilds/poverty dataset.
There are several steps to follow:

## Step 1
Download the poverty dataset

## Step 2
Create artificial data
-> How much?
-> Do the stlye transfer on the raw data, but then also add standart data augmentation for comparability.

## Step 3
Train the classic ERM algorithm on the augmented dataset

## Step 4
Compare the results to the ERM with normal data augmentation only
